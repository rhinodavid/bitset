# Bitset

## Overview

Bitset is a Go package that represents a set of positive integers as
a single integer, enabling small storage space and fast operations.

This data format was inspired by a need to use sets as keys for hashtables
in a solution for the
[traveling salesman problem](https://github.com/rhinodavid/travelingsalesman).
